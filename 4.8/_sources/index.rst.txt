Chaco |version|
===============

Chaco is a Python package for building interactive and custom 2-D plots and
visualizations.
Chaco facilitates writing
plotting applications at all levels of complexity, from simple scripts with
hard-coded data to large plotting programs with complex data interrelationships
and a multitude of interactive tools. While Chaco generates attractive static
plots for publication and presentation, it also works well for interactive
data visualization and exploration.
Chaco is part of the `Enthought Tool Suite <http://code.enthought.com/>`_.

Chaco includes renderers for many popular plot types, built-in implementations of
common interactions with those plots, and a framework for extending and
customizing plots and interactions.  Chaco can also render graphics in a
non-interactive fashion to images, in either raster or vector formats, and it
has a subpackage for doing command-line plotting or simple scripting.

For a quick sample of Chaco's features, see the
