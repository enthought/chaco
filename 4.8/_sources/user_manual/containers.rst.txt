Containers and Layout
*********************

Chaco containers
================

It is quite common to need to display multiple data side by side.
In order to arrange  plots and other components (e.g., colorbars, legends)
in a single panel,
Chaco uses *containers* to organize the layout.

Chaco implements 4 different containers:
:ref:`hv-plot-container`,
:ref:`grid-plot-container`, and :ref:`overlay-plot-container`.

All containers are derived from the base class
:class:`~chaco.base_plot_container.â€‹BasePlotContainer`, and share
a common interface:

* ``__init__(*components, **parameters)`` (constructor of the container object):
  The constructor of a plot container takes a sequence of
  components, which are added to the container itself,
  and a set of keyword arguments, which are used to initialize the
  parameters of the container. For example::

      container = HPlotContainer(scatter_plot, line_plot, spacing=100)

  creates a container with horizontal layout containing two plots
  (``scatter_plot`` and ``line_plot``), with a spacing of 100 pixels between
  them.

* ``add(*components)``: Append ore or more plots to the ones already present in the
  container. For example, this is equivalent to the code above::

      container = HPlotContainer(spacing=100)
      container.add(line_plot, scatter_plot)

* ``remove(self, *components)``: Remove a sequence of components from the
  container

* ``insert(index, component)``: Inserts a component at a specific position
  in the components list

.. note::

    **Each plot can have only one container**, so adding the same plot to
    a second container will remove it from the first one. In the same way,
    adding the same plot multiple times will not have create multiple
    copies. Instead, one should create multiple plots objects.

    E.g., this code::

            # Create a vertical container containing two horizontal containers
            h_container1 = HPlotContainer()
            h_container2 = HPlotContainer()
            outer_container = VPlotContainer(h_container1, h_container2,
                                             stack_order="top_to_bottom")

            # Add the three plots to the first container
            h_container1.add(scatter_plot, line_plot1, line_plot2)

            # Now add the first line plot to the second container => it is removed
            # from the first, as each plot can only have one container
            h_container2.add(line_plot1)

    results in this layout:

      .. image:: images/user_guide/one_container_per_plot.png
          :height: 200pt



.. _hv-plot-container:

HPlotContainer and VPlotContainer
---------------------------------

:class:`~chaco.plot_containers.HPlotContainer` and
:class:`~chaco.plot_containers.VPlotContainer` display a set of components
in an horizontal and vertical stack, respectively, as shown in these simple
examples:

.. image:: images/hplotcontainer.png
    :height: 200pt

.. image:: images/vplotcontainer.png
    :height: 200pt

In both cases, a series of line plots and scatter plots is added to an
:class:`~chaco.plot_containers.HPlotContainer` or a
:class:`~chaco.plot_containers.VPlotContainer`::

        # Create the data and the PlotData object
        x = linspace(-14, 14, 100)
        y = sin(x) * x**3
        plotdata = ArrayPlotData(x = x, y = y)

        # Create a scatter plot
        scatter_plot = Plot(plotdata)
        scatter_plot.plot(("x", "y"), type="scatter", color="blue")

        # Create a line plot
        line_plot = Plot(plotdata)
        line_plot.plot(("x", "y"), type="line", color="blue")

        # Create a horizontal container and put the two plots inside it
        container = HPlotContainer(line_plot, scatter_plot)
        self.plot = container


:class:`~chaco.plot_containers.HPlotContainer` is also used often to
display a colorbar or legend to the side of a plot. For example, this
plot

.. image:: images/user_guide/h_container_colorbar.png
  :height: 200pt

was created using a color-mapped scatter plot and a colorbar inside a
horizontal container::

        # Create the plot
        plot = Plot(data)
        plot.plot(("index", "value", "color"), type="cmap_scatter",
                  color_mapper=jet)

        # Create the colorbar, handing in the appropriate range and colormap
        colormap = plot.color_mapper
        colorbar = ColorBar(index_mapper=LinearMapper(range=colormap.range),
                            color_mapper=colormap,
                            orientation='v',
                            resizable='v',
                            width=30,
                            padding=20)

        colorbar.padding_top = plot.padding_top
        colorbar.padding_bottom = plot.padding_bottom

        # Create a container to position the plot and the colorbar side-by-side
        container = HPlotContainer(plot, colorbar)


HPlotContainer parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a list of parameters that are specific to
:class:`~chaco.plot_containers.HPlotContainer`

* ``stack_order``:
  The order in which components in the plot container are laid out. The
  default behavior is left-to-right. ::

      stack_order = Enum("left_to_right", "right_to_left")

* ``spacing``:
  The amount of space to put between components. ::

      spacing = Float(0.0)

* ``valign``:
  The vertical alignment of objects that don't span the full height. ::

      valign = Enum("bottom", "top", "center")


VPlotContainer parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a list of parameters that are specific to
:class:`~chaco.plot_containers.VPlotContainer`

* ``stack_order``:
  The order in which components in the plot container are laid out. The
  default behavior is bottom-to-top. ::

      stack_order = Enum("bottom_to_top", "top_to_bottom")

* ``spacing``:
  The amount of space to put between components.::

      spacing = Float(0.0)

* ``halign``:
  The horizontal alignment of objects that don't span the full width.::

    halign = Enum("left", "right", "center")


.. seealso::

    **HPlotContainer and VPlotContainer in action.** See ``demo/financial_plot.py``,
    ``demo/two_plots.py``, ``demo/advanced/scalar_image_function_inspector.py``,
    and ``demo/basc/cmap_scatter.py``
    in the Chaco examples directory.


.. _grid-plot-container:

GridPlotContainer
-----------------

Just as the name suggests, a :class:`~chaco.plot_containers.GridPlotContainer`
lays out plots in a regular grid.

Unlike the previous containers, one has to specify in advance the number
of rows and columns in the plot. Plots with different sizes and/or
aspect ratios are aligned according to the parameters ``halign`` and
``valign``.

For example, to generate this plot

.. image:: images/user_guide/grid_container.png
  :height: 250pt

one needs to create six plots of fixed height and add them successively
(left-to-right, top-to-bottom) to the
:class:`~chaco.plot_containers.GridPlotContainer`. Plots are aligned to
the top by setting ``valign = 'top'``.

The complete code looks like this:

::

    class GridContainerExample(HasTraits):

        plot = Instance(GridPlotContainer)

        traits_view = View(
            Item('plot', editor=ComponentEditor(), show_label=False),
            width=1000, height=600, resizable=True
        )

        def _plot_default(self):
            # Create a GridContainer to hold all of our plots: 2 rows, 3 columns
            container = GridPlotContainer(shape=(2,3),
                                          spacing=(10,5),
                                          valign='top',
                                          bgcolor='lightgray')

            # Create x data
            x = linspace(-5, 15.0, 100)
            pd = ArrayPlotData(index = x)

            # Plot some Bessel functions and add the plots to our container
            for i in range(6):
                data_name = 'y{}'.format(i)
                pd.set_data(data_name, jn(i,x))

                plot = Plot(pd)
                plot.plot(('index', data_name),
                          color=COLOR_PALETTE[i],
                          line_width=3.0)

                # Set each plot's aspect based on its position in the grid
                plot.set(height=((i % 3) + 1)*50,
                         resizable='h')

                # Add to the grid container
                container.add(plot)

            return container


GridPlotContainer parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a list of parameters that are specific to
:class:`~chaco.plot_containers.GridPlotContainer`

* ``valign``:
  The vertical alignment of objects that don't span the full height.::

    valign = Enum("bottom", "top", "center")


* ``halign``:
  The horizontal alignment of objects that don't span the full width.::

    halign = Enum("left", "right", "center")

* ``spacing``: A tuple or list of ``(h_spacing, v_spacing)``,
  giving spacing values
  for the horizontal and vertical direction. Default is (0, 0).

    in the Chaco examples directory.

.. _overlay-plot-container:

OverlayPlotContainer
--------------------

Overlay containers :class:`~chaco.plot_containers.OverlayPlotContainer`
lay out plots on top of each other.
The :class:`chaco.plot.Plot` class
in Chaco is a special subclass of
:class:`~chaco.plot_containers.OverlayPlotContainer`.

Overlay containers can be used to create "inset" plots. In the following
code, for instance, we create a zoomable plot with an fixed inset showing the
full data: ::

    class OverlayContainerExample(HasTraits):

        plot = Instance(OverlayPlotContainer)

        traits_view = View(
            Item('plot', editor=ComponentEditor(), show_label=False),
            width=800, height=600, resizable=True
        )

        def _plot_default(self):
            # Create data
            x = linspace(-5, 15.0, 100)
            y = jn(3, x)
            pd = ArrayPlotData(index=x, value=y)

            zoomable_plot = Plot(pd)
            zoomable_plot.plot(('index', 'value'),
                               name='external', color='red', line_width=3)

            # Attach tools to the plot
            zoom = ZoomTool(component=zoomable_plot,
                            tool_mode="box", always_on=False)
            zoomable_plot.overlays.append(zoom)
            zoomable_plot.tools.append(PanTool(zoomable_plot))

            # Create a second inset plot, not resizable, not zoom-able
            inset_plot = Plot(pd)
            inset_plot.plot(('index', 'value'), color='blue')
            inset_plot.set(resizable = '',
                           bounds = [250, 150],
                           position = [450, 350],
                           border_visible = True
                           )

            # Create a container and add our plots
            container = OverlayPlotContainer()
            container.add(zoomable_plot)
            container.add(inset_plot)
            return container

The code above generates this plot:

.. image:: images/user_guide/overlay_container_inset.png
  :height: 250pt

    axes on overlapping plots, see ``demo/multiaxis.py`` and

Sizing, rendering, events
=========================

Containers are responsible for a handling communication with the
components it contains, including
defining the rendering order, dispatching events, and
determining sizes.

Sizing
------

Containers are the elements that set sizes and do layout. Components within
containers declare their preferences, which are taken into account by
their container to set their final aspect.

The basic traits that control the layout preferences of a component are:

* :attr:`resizable`, a string indicating in which directions the component
  can be resized. Its value is one of ``''`` (not resizable), ``'h'``
  (resizable in the horizontal direction), ``'v'`` (resizable in the
  vertical direction), ``'hv'`` (resizable in both, default).
* :attr:`aspect_ratio`, the ratio of the component's width to its height.
  This is used by the component itself to maintain bounds when the bounds
  are changed independently. Default is ``None``, meaning that the aspect
  ratio is not enforced.
* :attr:`padding_left`, :attr:`padding_right`,
  :attr:`padding_top`, :attr:`padding_bottom` set the amount of padding space
  to leave around the component (default is 0). The property :attr:`padding`
  allows to set all of them as a tuple (left, right, top, bottom).
* :attr:`auto_center`, controls the behavior when the component's bounds are
  set to a value that does not conform its aspect ratio. If ``True``
  (default), the component centers itself in the free space.
* :attr:`fixed_preferred_size`: If the component is resizable, this attribute
  specifies the amount of space that the component would like to get in each
  dimension, as a tuple (width, height). This attribute can be used to
  establish
  relative sizes between resizable components in a container: if one
  component specifies, say, a fixed preferred width of 50 and another one
  specifies a fixed preferred width of 100, then the latter component will
  always be twice as wide as the former.

You can get access to the actual bounds of the component, (including
padding and border) using the
``outer`` properties:

* :attr:`outer_position`, the x,y point of the lower left corner of the
  padding outer box around
  the component. Use :meth:`set_outer_position` to change these values.
* :attr:`outer_bounds`,
  the number of horizontal and vertical pixels in the padding outer box.
  Use :meth:`set_outer_bounds` to change these values.
* :attr:`outer_x`, :attr:`outer_y`, :attr:`outer_x2`, :attr:`outer_y2:,
  :attr:`outer_width`, :attr:`outer_height`:
  coordinates of lower-left pixel of the box,
  coordinates of the upper-right pixel of the box,
  width and height of the outer box in pixels

See also the documentation of the class :class:`enable.component.Component`
for more details about the internal parameters of Chaco components.

The container can set the attribute :attr:`fit_components` to control if
it should resize itself to fit its components. Allowed values are
``''`` (do not resize, default), ``'h'``
(resize in the horizontal direction), ``'v'`` (resize in the
vertical direction), ``'hv'`` (resize in both).


Rendering order
---------------

Every plot component has several layers:

1. :attr:`background`: Background image, shading, and borders
2. :attr:`underlay`: Axes and grids
3. :attr:`image`: A special layer for plots that render as images.  This is in
    a separate layer since these plots must all render before non-image
    plots.
4. :attr:`plot`: The main plot area
5. :attr:`annotation`: Lines and text that are conceptually part of the "plot" but
   need to be rendered on top of everything else in the plot.
6. :attr:`overlay`: Legends, selection regions, and other tool-drawn visual
    elements

These are defined by :attr:`~chaco.plot_component.DEFAULT_DRAWING_ORDER`,
and stored in the :attr:`drawing_order` trait.

Complexity arises when you have multiple components in a container: How do
their layers affect each other? Do you want the "overlay" layer of a component
to draw on top of all components? Do you want the "background" elements
to be behind everything else?

This is resolved by the :attr:`unified_draw` trait. The container will
draw all layers in succession. If a component sets :attr:`unified_draw`
to ``False`` (default), the container will ask it to draw the corresponding
layer as it is reached in the loop. If :attr:`unified_draw` is ``True``,
the whole component will draw in one go when the container reaches
the layer specified in the attribute ``component.draw_layer``,
which by default is 'plot'.

For example, if you want a plot to act as an overlay, you could set
``unified_draw = True`` and ``draw_layer = 'overlay'``. These values tell the
container to render the component when it gets to the 'overlay' layer.

Set :attr:`overlay_border` to True if you want the border to draw as part of
the overlay; otherwise it draws as part of the background. By default,
the border is drawn just inside the plot area; set :attr:`inset_border` to
False to draw it just outside the plot area.

Backbuffer
^^^^^^^^^^

A backbuffer provides the ability to render into an offscreen buffer, which is
blitted on every draw, until it is invalidated. Various traits such as
:attr:`use_backbuffer` and :attr:`backbuffer_padding` control the behavior of
the backbuffer. A backbuffer is used for non-OpenGL backends, such as `agg`
and on OS X. If :attr:`use_backbuffer` is False, a backbuffer is never used,
even if a backbuffer is referenced by a component.


Dispatching events
------------------

The logic of event dispatching is defined in the 'enable' library, which
defines the superclasses for Chaco's containers and components.
In summary, when a component gets an event, it dispatches it to:

1. its overlays, in reverse order that they were added and are drawn
2. itself, so that any event handler methods on itself get called
3. its underlays, in reverse order that they were added and are drawn
4. its listener tools

On each of these elements, Chaco looks for a method of the form
``{component_state}_{event_name}``. For example,
in response to the user pressing the left mouse button
on a tool in state ``normal`` (the default state, see :ref:`Tool_States`),
Chaco would look for a method called ``normal_left_down``.

If this exists, the event is
dispatched and the component decides whether to handle the element
and set ``event.handled = True``, in which case the dispatch chain is
interrupted.

.. note::

    If the attribute :attr:`auto_handle_event` of the
    component is set to ``True``, calling the event
    method automatically sets ``event.handled = True``.


Possible event names are:

.. hlist::
  :columns: 4

  * left_down
  * left_up
  * left_dclick
  * right_down
  * right_up
  * right_dclick
  * middle_down
  * middle_up
  * middle_dclick
  * mouse_move
  * mouse_wheel
  * mouse_enter
  * mouse_leave
  * key_pressed
  * key_released
  * character
  * dropped_on
  * drag_over
  * drag_enter
  * drag_leave

Most objects default to having just a single event
state, which is the "normal" event state. To make a component that
handled a left-click, you could subclass
:class:`~chaco.plot_component.PlotComponent`, and implement
:meth:`normal_left_down` or :meth:`normal_left_up`. The signature for handler
methods is just one parameter, which is an event object that is an instance of
(a subclass of) :class:`~enable.events.BasicEvent`.
Subclasses of :class:`~enable.events.BasicEvent`
are :class:`~enable.events.MouseEvent`, :class:`~enable.events.DragEvent`,
:class:`~enable.events.KeyEvent`, and
:class:`~enable.events.BlobEvent` and :class:`~enable.events.BlobFrameEvent`
(for multitouch). It's fairly easy to extend this event
system with new kinds of events and new suffixes (as was done for multitouch).

Events contain a reference to the GUI toolkit window that generated them
as :attr:`event.window`.
A common pattern is for component to call methods on the window
to do things like set a tooltip or create a context menu.
A draw or update of the window does not
actually happen until the next :meth:`paint`.
By that time, the
component no longer has a reference to the event or the event's window,
but uses instead
its own reference to the window, :attr:`self.window`.

See also the `documentation of the enable library
<http://docs.enthought.com/enable/enable_concepts.html>`_, which gives
more details about the event dispatching happening at that level.
