Chaco CHANGELOG
===============

What's new in Chaco 5.0.0

Change summary since 4.6.0

New Features

 * Experimental Python 3 support. The Chaco codebase has been ported to run on
   Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4.  The basic test suite runs without error
   on 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 on Travis CI, but has not been extensively used yet.
   Feedback appreciated. (PR#259)


What's new in Chaco 4.6.0
-------------------------

Change summary since 4.5.0

Enhancements

 * More comprehensive testing for AbstractDataSource subclasses (PR #244).

Fixes

 * Workaround RuntimeWarnings from nanmin and nanmax in ImageData.get_bounds
   (PR #242).


What's new in Chaco 4.5.0
-------------------------

Change summary since 4.4.1

New features/Improvements

 * Added perceptual colormaps by Matteo Niccoli, Dave Green and Kenneth Moreland.
 * Added `asynchronous_updates.py` demo that shows a pattern for generating
   expensive plots while keeping the interface responsive (PR#170).
 * Speeded up by 10x the data mappers of the `GridMapper` class (mapping of 2D data
   to/from screen space).


Fixes

 * Restored fast renderers for scatterplots that were unintentionally removed in
   PR#101 (PR#175).
 * Make the `alpha` attribute of scatter plots work as intended (PR#164).
 * Resume running test for empty container that has been skipped (PR#190).
 * Improved handling of missing or empty data in scatterplot (PR#210)
 * Avoid a NumPy crash when using a data source of a unicode array (PR#213).
 * PanTool with `restrict_to_data` selected works with empty data sources
   (PR#215).
 * RangeSelection properly clips bounds when leaving selection area (PR#217).
 * Fix white gap between image border and image (PR#219).
 * Fix redraw color mapped image plot when color mapper updates (PR#221)
 * Fix behaviour of mappers when stretch_data trait is False (PR#227)
 * ColormappedScatterplot now redraws when colour mapâ€™s updated event fires (PR#230)
 * Speed improvements for scatter plots with lots of points (PR#234)


Maintenance

 * Added unit tests for ColormappedScatterplot (PR#231).


Release 4.4.1
-------------
This release contains a lot of enhancements and bug fixes mostly to the OOP API of Chaco but also its shell mode.


Change summary since 4.3.0

New features

 * Improved ArrayPlotData to support changing multiple arrays without triggering a re-plot after each update. This
   prevents the plot from being temporarily out of synch, which is important if the index and the values are both
   changed to new values with different shapes (PR#124).
 * Added control of the maximum width of a tick label. Provided that hook to the TextBoxOverlay (PR#128).
 * Added control to generate fixed aspect ratio grid mappers (PR#129). This allows various 2D plots to control the
   shape of the pixels in an image.

Enhancements

 * Improved the display of multi-word titles (PR#148).
 * Minor improvements to the documentation (PR#134, PR#118).
 * Made the cmap_image_plot caching more efficient and faster in large data situations (PR#123).
 * Improved support for exporting to multipage PDF (PR#109) and drawing in landscape orientation (PR#115).
 * Added control over whether a border for an overlay should be drawn (PR#116).
 * Made LineSegmentTool work with BasePlot2D (PR#121).
 * TextBoxOverlay now exposes the text color as a top level trait (PR#120).
 * Added Travis-CI support for python 2.6 and 2.7 (PR#136, PR#145, PR#146). Github now displays the status inside
   each Pull Requests as well as in the README.rst on the project github landing page.

Fixes

 * Fixed clipping issue when exporting plot to SVG (PR#111) and PDF (PR#109).
 * Fixed export to png, bmp, jpg formats in the shell mode (PR#149).
 * Removed unexpected zoom when panning if the pan tool has restrict_to_data set to True and the plot has nonlinear
   axes (PR#150).
 * Fixed a few of failing unit tests (PR#143).
 * Fix sort_order bug (PR#141, issue#119).
