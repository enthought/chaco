        index : int
            An index into the plot's index array(s). Typically this index is just
            an integer, but if the plot has a 2-D index dimension, then this method
            returns a tuple of integers. If the input point cannot be mapped to an
            index, then None is returned.

            If *screen_pt* corresponds to multiple indices, then only the first
            index is returned.
