    A container for PlotComponents that conforms to being laid out by
    PlotFrames.  Serves as the base class for other PlotContainers.

    PlotContainers define a layout, i.e., a spatial relationship between
    their contained components.  (BasePlotContainer doesn't define one,
    but its various subclasses do.)

    BasePlotContainer is a subclass of Enable Container, so it is possible to
    insert Enable-level components into it.  However, because Enable
    components don't have the correct interfaces to participate in layout,
    the visual results will probably be incorrect.
