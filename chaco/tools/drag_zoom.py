    """A zoom tool that zooms continuously with a mouse drag movement, instead
    of using a zoom box or range.

    By default, the tool maintains aspect ratio and zooms the plot's X and Y
    axes by the same amount as the user drags up and down.  (In this default
    configuration, the horizontal position of the drag motion has no effect.)

    By setting **maintain_aspect_ratio** to False, this tool will separably zoom
    the X and Y axis ranges by the (possibly different) horizontal and vertical
    drag motions.  This is similar to the drag zoom interaction in Matplotlib.

    By setting single_axis to True, dragging will only zoom in the axis specified
    by the axis attribute.

    By setting restrict_domain to True, the zoom will be limited to the domain
    of the axis mappers.
