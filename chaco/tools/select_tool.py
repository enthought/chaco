    #:     **multiselect_modifier**. The only way to deselect points is by
    #:     clicking on them; clicking on a screen space outside of the plot does
    #:     not deselect points.
    #: "multi"
    #:     Like **toggle** mode, except that the user can deselect all points
    #:     at once by clicking on the plot area away from a point.
