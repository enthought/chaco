Chaco Documentation
===================

Chaco is a Python package for building interactive and custom 2-D plots and
visualizations. It is part of the `Enthought Tool Suite <http://code.enthought.com/>`_. 

It is meant to facilitate writing plotting applications of all levels of complexity, 
from simple scripts with hard-coded data to integrated plotting within large programs 
with large datasets and a multitude of interactive tools. 
While Chaco generates nice static plots for publication and presentation purposes, its 
components are all designed to be work well for interactive data visualization.

Chaco includes renderers for many popular plot types, built-in implementations of
common interactions with those plots, and a framework for extending and
customizing plots and interactions.  Chaco can also render graphics in a
non-interactive fashion to images, in either raster or vector formats, and it
has a subpackage for doing command-line plotting or simple scripting.
