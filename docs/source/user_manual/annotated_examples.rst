Annotated Examples
##################

This section describes each of the examples provided with Chaco.  Each example
is designed to be a stand-alone demonstration of some of Chaco's features.
Though they are simple, many of the examples have capabilities that are
difficult to find in other plotting packages.

Extensibility is a core design goal of Chaco, and many people have used the
examples as starting points for their own applications.

``bar_plot_stacked.py``
-----------------------
An example showing Chaco's BarPlot class.

source: `bar_plot_stacked.py <https://github.com/enthought/chaco/tree/master/examples/demo/basic/bar_plot_stacked.py>`_

.. image:: example_images/bar_plot.png

``bigdata.py``
--------------
Demonstrates chaco performance with large datasets.

There are 10 plots with 100,000 points each.  Right-click and drag to
create a range selection region.  The region can be moved around and
resized (drag the edges).  These interactions are very fast because
of the backbuffering built into chaco.

Zooming with the mousewheel and the zoombox (as described in simple_line.py)
is also available, but panning is not.

source: `bigdata.py <https://github.com/enthought/chaco/tree/master/examples/demo/bigdata.py>`_

.. image:: example_images/bigdata.png

``cursor_tool_demo.py``
-----------------------
A Demonstration of the CursorTool functionality

Left-button drag to move the cursors round.
Right-drag to pan the plots. 'z'-key to Zoom

source: `cursor_tool_demo.py <https://github.com/enthought/chaco/tree/master/examples/demo/cursor_tool_demo.py>`_

.. image:: example_images/cursor_tool_demo.png

``data_labels.py``
------------------
Draws a line plot with several points labelled.  Demonstrates how to annotate
plots.

source: `edit_line.py <https://github.com/enthought/chaco/tree/master/examples/demo/edit_line.py>`_

.. image:: example_images/edit_line.png

``financial_plot.py``
---------------------
Implementation of a standard financial plot visualization using Chaco renderers
and scales. Right-clicking and selecting an area in the top window zooms in
the corresponding area in the lower window.

source: `financial_plot.py <https://github.com/enthought/chaco/tree/master/examples/demo/financial_plot.py>`_

.. image:: example_images/financial_plot.png

``financial_plot_dates.py``
---------------------------
Implementation of a standard financial plot visualization using Chaco renderers
and scales. Right-clicking and selecting an area in the top window zooms in
the corresopnding area in the lower window.
This differs from the financial_plot.py example in that it uses a date-oriented
axis.

source: `financial_plot_dates.py <https://github.com/enthought/chaco/tree/master/examples/demo/financial_plot_dates.py>`_

.. image:: example_images/financial_plot_dates.png

Y range for each plot.  Also has a second Y-axis on the right hand side.
Demonstrates use of the BroadcasterTool.

source: `multiaxis.py <https://github.com/enthought/chaco/tree/master/examples/demo/multiaxis.py>`_

.. image:: example_images/multiaxis.png

``multiaxis_using_Plot.py``
---------------------------
Draws some x-y line and scatter plots. On the left hand plot:
 - Left-drag pans the plot.
 - Mousewheel up and down zooms the plot in and out.
 - Pressing "z" opens the Zoom Box, and you can click-drag a rectangular 
   region to zoom. If you use a sequence of zoom boxes, pressing alt-left-arrow
   and alt-right-arrow moves you forwards and backwards through the "zoom 
   history".

source: `multiaxis_using_Plot.py <https://github.com/enthought/chaco/tree/master/examples/demo/multiaxis_using_Plot.py>`_

This demo shows how Chaco and Traits can be used to easily build a data
acquisition and visualization system.

Two frames are opened: one has the plot and allows configuration of
various plot properties, and one which simulates controls for the hardware
device from which the data is being acquired; in this case, it is a mockup
random number generator whose mean and standard deviation can be controlled
by the user.
