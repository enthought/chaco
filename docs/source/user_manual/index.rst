This guide is designed to act as a conceptual guide to Chaco, an open-source
data visualization library built and maintained by Enthought, Inc.  Chaco is
a set of interactive visualization tools built on top of the Enable and Kiva
2D drawing libraries and designed to complement other Enthought rapid
application development tools including Traits and TraitsUI.  This guide
discussed many, but not all of the features of Chaco.  For complete details
of the Chaco API, refer to the Chaco API documentation.
