.. _built_in_tutorials:

Built-in tutorials
------------------

For more details on how to use Chaco to embed powerful plotting
functionality inside applications, refer to the :ref:`tutorials` page.
In particular, some tutorial examples were added into the
:file:`examples/tutorials/scipy2008/` directory.  These examples are
numbered and introduce
concepts one at a time, going from a simple line plot to building a
custom overlay with its own trait editor and reusing an existing tool
from the built-in set of tools.  You can browse them on the GitHub repository
at:
https://github.com/enthought/chaco/tree/master/examples/tutorials .
Finally, it is recommended to explore the examples
(:ref:`examples` section) as they are regularly updated to reflect the most recent
changes and recommended ways to use Chaco.


.. _chaco_webinars:

Enthought webinars
------------------
The video webinars given in  as part of the Enthought webinar
series cover building interactive plotting using Chaco. If you are an
EPD user, you can find the video, the slides, and the demo code for
each webinar covering Chaco.

* The first one (April 2010) demoes how to use Chaco as your plotting
  tool (https://www.enthought.com/repo/epd/webinars/2010-04InteractiveChaco/ ).

* The seconds (October 2010) illustrates how to building interactive 2D visualization (see
  https://www.enthought.com/repo/epd/webinars/2010-10Building2DInteractiveVisualizations/ ).
