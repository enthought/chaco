Tutorials, webinars, and examples
=================================

Tutorials
---------

* :ref:`Tutorial: Interactive plotting with Chaco <tutorial>`

  This is
  the main Chaco tutorial and introduces the basic concepts of
  how to use Chaco and Traits UI to do basic plots, customize
  layout, and add interactivity.

* :ref:`Tutorial: Using Chaco from IPython <tutorial_ipython>`

  This tutorial
  explains how to use Chaco from IPython using the Chaco ``shell``
  command-line plotting interface to build plots, in
  a Matlab or gnuplot-like style.

Examples
--------

* The :ref:`annotated examples <examples>` is a useful visual resource
  presenting a set of Chaco plots together with their source code.

* :ref:`Modeling Van del Waal's Equations <tutorial_van_der_waal>`
  is a complete example of creating a data
  model and then using Traits and Chaco to rapidly create interactive
  plot GUIs.

* :ref:`Creating an interactive Hyetograph <tutorial_hyetograph>`
  is an example of a hyetograph (a plot of rainfall intensity in relation
  to time) application. This example introduces the ``on_trait_listener``
  decorator and uses Chaco, simple Traits views, and live GUI interaction.
