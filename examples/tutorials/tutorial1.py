# First, we create two arrays of data, x and y.  'x' will be a sequence of
# 100 points spanning the range -2pi to 2pi, and 'y' will be sin(x).

# Now that we have our data, we can use a factory function to create the
# line plot for us.  Chaco provides a few factories to simplify creating common
# plot types (line, scatter, etc.).  In later tutorials we'll see what the
# factories are actually doing, and how to manually assemble plotting
# primitives in more powerful ways.  For now, factories suit our needs.

    (x, y), bgcolor="white", add_grid=True, add_axis=True

# (Normally, when Chaco plots are placed inside WX windows, the bounds are
# set automatically by the window.)

    # created for us by the window.)
